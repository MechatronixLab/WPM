## WPM-C011 - Wearable Patient Monitor prototype based on STM32C011
  
This project consists of an initial prototype of a Wearable Patient Monitor, to be submitted to the STM32 Wireless Innovation Contest from Elektor Magazine.
  
The device will present the following sensors:  
- MAX30102 pulse oximetry sensor  
- XXXXXX temperature sensor  
- XXXXXX inertial measurement unit (6 DOF)  
  
Initial software development is being made on a Franzininho C0 board that contains a STM32C011F6P6 MCU.  

## Tools  
STM32CubeIDE V 1.13.2
